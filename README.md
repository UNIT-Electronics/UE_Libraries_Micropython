# UE_Libraries_Micropython

The libraries published here focus on development in MicroPython, offering updated versions of various programs. These programs are available on the free PyPI platform, ensuring easy implementation.

## Ocks

This library features a modified version of the [micropython-ssd1306 library](https://github.com/stlehmann/micropython-ssd1306/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file), aimed at streamlining the installation process. In this project, we have removed support for SPI, retaining only the I2C functionality from the original library. 
The primary focus of this repository is to prepare the library for uploading to PyPI, including renaming it before the upload.
